# Library

Repository of all the books that I have read, are currently reading, 
or simply have as reference documents that I use when working on projects. 

## Currently reading
- Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom

My goal for diving into this book is to get a better understanding on 
compilers.  With a better understanding of how languages and compilers 
work, I will be able to write better code, learn new languages more easily, 
and have a better view of what code is doing 'under the hood'
